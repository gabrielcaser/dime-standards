        This checklist lists important factors to consider while reviewing your code review partner's code package. Please fill this checklist, and submit it as an attachment when you submit \href{https://survey.wb.surveycto.com/collect/code_review_summary?caseid=}{this detailed form.}
        
		\section*{Overview - First Impression}

        Once you have confirmed that you received a package from your code review partner, please refer to the following list for basic recommended practices:
        \begin{itemize}
			\setlength\itemsep{-0.1em}		
			
			\item[] \dimeCheckBox{ Scripts for data cleaning, variable creation, and analysis are separate; and analysis scripts do not include any data processing, unless necessary for the creation of a table or graphic}
			\item[] \dimeCheckBox{ Variable construction scripts include detailed comments about each variable created}
			\item[] \dimeCheckBox{ Analysis scripts do not depend on having the results of other scripts in memory, except for the Master script}
			\item[] \dimeCheckBox{ All scripts are well-commented and formatted, such that one can easily identify functional chunks of code and evaluate whether they correctly implement the econometric or statistical process described}
			\item[] \dimeCheckBox{ Tables are output as .csv or .tex files or other raw text files when possible}
		\end{itemize}
	
		\vspace{.6em}

        \section*{Reproducibility}

        \begin{itemize}
			\setlength\itemsep{-0.1em}
			\item[] \dimeCheckBox{Code ran perfectly on the first run \textbf{(Applicable only if data was shared with you.)}}
			\item[] \dimeCheckBox{Outputs shared (if any) replicated perfectly on the first run}
            \item[] \dimeCheckBox{If not, was able to determine the reason for why outputs changed}
			\item[] \dimeCheckBox{Make note of any issues you faced in these steps. You will need to provide this information in \href{https://survey.wb.surveycto.com/collect/code_review_summary?caseid=}{this detailed review summary form.}}
			
		\end{itemize}
		
        \vspace{.6em}

       \section*{Ease of Use and Understanding}

       
        \begin{itemize}
			\setlength\itemsep{-0.1em}
			\item[] \dimeCheckBox{Understood the code from original documentation and README file}
			\item[] \dimeCheckBox{Package needed additional information}
            \item[] \dimeCheckBox{Understood the purpose of the code}
			\item[] \dimeCheckBox{As a new RA joining this project right now, will need additional support to be able to contribute to this code}
                \item[] \dimeCheckBox{Make note of what additional materials would help. You will need to provide this information in \href{https://survey.wb.surveycto.com/collect/code_review_summary?caseid=}{this detailed review summary form.}}
                \item \dimeTextField{time}{1 cm}{\textbf{Approximate time} needed to understand the code well enough to contribute \textbf{(0-3 days)}: }
                \item \dimeTextField{time}{2.5 cm}{How likely is it that you would need to make multiple changes all over the code if you were to change a core task \textbf{\textit{(Don't know, very unlikely, unlikely, somewhat likely, very likely)}}:}
			
		\end{itemize}

        \vspace{.6em}

        \section*{Coding Practices}
        In this section, select the box next to each pracitce if the mentioned coding practice was used in some form in the code package. Also make note of whether it was implemented perfectly, or if there is room for improvement. You will need to provide this information in \href{https://survey.wb.surveycto.com/collect/code_review_summary?caseid=}{this detailed review summary form.}

        \begin{itemize}
        \item[] \dimeCheckBox{Master script}
        \item[] \dimeCheckBox{Use of comments}
        \item[] \dimeCheckBox{Documentation}
        \item[] \dimeCheckBox{Folder organisation}
        \item[] \dimeCheckBox{Naming practices}
        \item[] \dimeCheckBox{Code organization - sections, tracking inputs and outputs for each script}
        \item[] \dimeCheckBox{Use of white spaces}
        \item[] \dimeCheckBox{Use of loops}
        \item[] \dimeCheckBox{Abstraction - using functions to do commonly repeated tasks}
        
        
        \end{itemize}
        \vspace{.6em}

        \section*{Final Comments}
        In this section, make note of the following: (You will need to provide this information in \href{https://survey.wb.surveycto.com/collect/code_review_summary?caseid=}{this detailed review summary form.)}
          \item[] \dimeCheckBox{Three main strengths of the code reviewed}
          \item[] \dimeCheckBox{Suggestions on how the coder can improve}
          \item[] \dimeCheckBox{Any additional feedback.}
