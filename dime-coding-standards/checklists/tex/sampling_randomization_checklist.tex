		\section*{Sampling and Randomization tasks}
  This checklist lists important factors to consider while reviewing your code review partner's \textbf{sampling/randomization} code. Please fill this checklist, and submit it as an attachment when you submit \href{https://survey.wb.surveycto.com/collect/code_review_summary?caseid=}{this detailed form.}

  \textbf{Note:} We are piloting this checklist as part of improving the code review process. The questions in this list are therefore \textbf{not required}, and we welcome your feedback on the points listed below.

            \item[]\dimeCheckBox{\textbf{The code clearly identifies the population eligible for sampling}. (This should be in the form of an original dataset that is fixed, unless sampling is continuous or ongoing due to research design; in that case, this should be clearly described)}

                \item[]\dimeCheckBox{\textbf{Advanced check:} Clusters, strata, and individual-level IDs do not contain unmasked information about the identity of the clusters, strata, or individuals.} 

                \item[] \dimeCheckBox{\textbf{Advanced check:} The original dataset should be checks for stability when loaded, using some combination of commands like \texttt{datasignature}, file hashing, \texttt{assert}, and/or \texttt{isid, sort} (or an equivalent in other coding languages.)}
