# Data construction code review checklist

**Data source/survey round:**

**Date:**  

## List of files to be checked
_Add names or links_:
- Master script
- Constructed dataset(s)
- Construction scripts (list by order of priority)

## List of auxiliary documents
- Documentation
- Main constructed variables to be checked

## Reproducibility
- [ ] All scripts run from the master after adding the correct folder path to line(s) X (and XX)
- [ ] The master script is organized in a way that allows you to understand the general tasks being performed in the code
- [ ] The master script tracks which scripts create and use which files

## Code organization and readability
- [ ] Code file names are informative 
- [ ] It is clear in the code why tasks are being executed
- [ ] The code structure facilitates understanding of the tasks
- [ ] Code uses white space to improve readability
- [ ] There is extensive use of comments to explain the code
- [ ] The code is efficient (tasks are executed in the simplest way possible, loops are used when needed rather than repeating lines, pre-defined functions are used)
- [ ] Common tasks are abstracted and automated (e.g. using functions or macros)

## Construction scripts
- [ ] Do you understand how and why each variable is constructed? If not, indicate to the author where more comments are needed.
- [ ] Check merges. Are any observations dropped or does the number of observations increase? If so, is there a clear justification for that? If any observations didn't match, is that explained in the comments?
- [ ] Check collapses, reshapes, and groupwise calculations (`bys` and `egen` for example). How are missing values treated? Does the sort order of the data matter or is the result uniquely determined? Is the number of observations correct and are the mathematics correct?
- [ ] Check winsorization or other techniques for handling outliers. Is the reason for the chosen transformation explained? Is there documentation explaining how parameters such as cutoff percentiles were chosen and why one or both tails were altered?
- [ ] Check treatment of missing values. Are research decisions well documented? Are there cases where you think missing values are being created or replaced unintentionally?
- [ ] Check creation of new variables. Does the code match the variable definition in the documentation? Is the correct function being used?
- [ ] Is there always clear documentation of why observations are dropped, if any?

## Constructed dataset(s)
- [ ] Is the resulting dataset tidy (each row is an observation, each column is a variable)?
- [ ] Are variable names informative?
- [ ] Are variable labels informative?
- [ ] Are value labels informative?
- [ ] Are all labels grammatically correct and free of special characters?
- [ ] Is there clear documentation (variable dictionary, variable labels, value labels, notes, comments) about variable definition?
- [ ] Are dataset file names informative?
