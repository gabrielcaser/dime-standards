# DIME Research Transparency Standards 

Researchers must register the study prior to receiving implementation funding. The pre-registration link must be entered in MyIE. The following are some of the most commonly used tools:
- [American Economic Association's Randomized Control Trial Registry](https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/)
- [Registry for International Development Impact Evaluations (RIDIE)](https://ridie.3ieimpact.org/), hosted by the [Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie)](https://www.3ieimpact.org/). This registry allows for registration of non-experimental designs as well.
