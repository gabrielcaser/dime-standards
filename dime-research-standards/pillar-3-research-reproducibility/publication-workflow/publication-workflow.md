# Workflow for the delivery of reproducibility verification results and publication of packages

## Delivery of results
- The reviewers will deliver the reproducibility verification results over email to the authors on the due date
- If the paper passed the reproducibility verification, the reviewers will ask the authors to reply within the next three working days if they plan to apply further changes to the reproducibility package and by when they would be applied. Changes can include any code or documentation suggestions made by the reviewers in the results report or further changes that the authors might want to apply

## Publication of packages

- If the authors do not plan to apply further changes, the code of the reproducibility package will be published by the reviewers within the next five working days of having received the reply from them. The code posted will include any corrections the reviewers might have had to apply to enable a one-button run such as: correction of paths and variable names, automated installation of packages, and others. Every correction applied except for the automated installation of packages would have had to be confirmed by the authors upon the confirmation of the reproducibility package submission.
- If the authors wish to apply further changes to the code, they will provide an estimated turnaround for the updated reproducibility package. On the due date, the reviewers will confirm that the changes applied did not change the reproducibility of the paper analyzed and will publish the updated code within the next five working days of having received the updated package
