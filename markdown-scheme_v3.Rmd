# Template: Code repository catalogue

1. Create new project: Type script
2. Screenshot of the \emph{complete} first page
3. For a published paper, prepare the link to the repository. For a WP prepare a zip that contains all data and code; For \textbf{DIME verified} packages also the reproducibility verification statement

# Open Issues and Remarks
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textcolor{green}{Resolved}\textcolor{lightgray}{Tags: We use tag group Reproducible, YES, NO, PARTIAL, shown is then only the value and not the tag group. Do we have to tag like: reproducible, partially reproducible, not reproducible?}
    \item \textcolor{orange}{Partially Resolved: UPI?}Information on Metadata:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item Abbreviation: Fine. But also use an identifier. Perhaps UPI is problematic if this is public.Use a new
              identifier?
      \end{enumerate}
    \item Project description
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textcolor{green}{Resolved}\textcolor{lightgray}{Creating a primary ID: Use country ISO 3 code or not? Use RR for working papers, PP for published papers (see         naming convention in Proj\_descr, Title statement above)}
        \item Authors and contributors
          \begin{enumerate}
            \item Contributors: Should RAs only be named if they contributed to the code?
            \item Acknowledgment: To include or not? (Little work, little value?)
          \end{enumerate}
        \item Processes and Output
          \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textcolor{green}{Resolved}\textcolor{gray}{Kept, bc maybe useful for WP}
            \item Unused fields for PP: Should we use these for WP? An alternative is not to use these (in particular Process) and add working paper and published version separately.
              \begin{itemize}
                \item Process: Description:
                 \begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
                    This element is used to document the life cycle of the research project, from its design and inception to its conclusion. This can include phases of fundraising, approval by a review board, concept note review, data acquisition, analysis, publishing of a working paper, peer review, publishing in journal, presentation to conferences, publishing, evaluation, reporting to sponsors, etc. It is recommended to provide these steps in a chronological order.
                 \end{lstlisting}
                 \item Approval process:
                 \begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
                    The "Approval process" is a group of six elements used to describe the formal approval process(es) (if any) that the project had to go through. This may for example include an approval by an Ethics Board to collect new data, followed by an internal review process to endorse the results.
                 \end{lstlisting}
              \end{itemize}
          \end{enumerate}
        \item Methods, software and scripts:
          \begin{enumerate}
            \item Remark: Field Methods: There are two method field: one stand-alone, one with Scripts. Current usage: Stand-alone for econometric/statistical techniques (e.g. OLS, random forests...). This field will learn and suggest keywords.
          \end{enumerate}
      \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

# Errors and Issues
\begin{enumerate}
\item \begin{verbatim}proj_descr_script.[0].title\end{verbatim} is missing: this is caused by: in methods, software, scripts a file name was given, but a title is missing. \textbf{Title is obligatory, conditional on file name entered}
\item \textcolor{green}{Resolved: Works now.}\textcolor{lightgray}{In Processes and output, in URL, the protocol https is not accepted. The editor sometimes shows an error, but this has no consequence}
\item in \begin{verbatim} External Resource, File type\end{verbatim} there is no option package (only prg,...). Perhaps one would want to have this option, because we refer to whole packages, if the source is external
\item There is no real field \begin{verbatim} Journal \end{verbatim}. For published articles, one cannot indicate in which journal it was published.
\item In Scope, Topic it would be nice to have all JEL descriptions available once on enters the code
\item In Software, libraries: sometimes the following error is raised: Must be an array. One cannot enter more than one package
\item (On the external instance) In Scripts, License, License is not displayed, although a value is supplied
\item One has to supply completion date for the cataloge page to show the year (WLD xxxx). Working papers have no completion date if seen as project. Just a version date.
\end{enumerate}
